# This is part 3 of the week 2 quiz. 
# This function will only consider files with a specific threshold of data collected, 
# and then correlate the data points of those files. It will return a vector of 
# correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 

corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
        ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the location of the CSV files

        ## 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
        ## number of completely observed observations (on all
        ## variables) required to compute the correlation between
        ## nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0

        ## Return a numeric vector of correlations
        ## NOTE: Do not round the result!
